# Mirrorlist
Simple [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) mirrorlist generator, written in Go

## Build
Use Go compiler to build `mirrorlist` executable.
```
$ go build
```

## Usage
There're several flags that can be used with `mirrorlist`. Define count of mirrors to be generated by using `-count` flag. It should be integer. The default value is `3`.
```
$ mirrorlist -count=10
```
Define maximum response time in seconds for each mirror by using `-time` flag. All mirrors that has response time greater than this value will be skipped. It should be float. The default value is `1`.
```
$ mirrorlist -time=5
```
Define source mirrorlist URL by using `-url` flag. Source code will check mirrors in this URL. It should be string and must be a valid [mirrorlist](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors). If `-url` flag is not defined, source code will check `https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all` by default.
```
$ mirrorlist -url=https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=AU
```
Here's a full example.
```
$ mirrorlist -count=10 -time=5 -url=https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=AU > mirrorlist
```
