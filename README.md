# Mirrorlist
Simple [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) mirrorlist generator, written in Go

## Build
Use Go compiler to build `mirrorlist` executable.
```
$ go build
```

## Usage
There're several flags that can be used with `mirrorlist`. Define count of mirrors to be generated by using `-c` flag. It should be integer and the default value is `3`.
```
$ mirrorlist -c 10
```
Define maximum response time in seconds for each mirror by using `-m` flag. All mirrors that has response time greater than this value will be skipped. It should be float and the default value is `1`.
```
$ mirrorlist -m 5
```
Define source mirrorlist URL by using `-u` flag. Source code will check mirrors in this URL. It should be string and must be a valid [mirrorlist](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/mirrors). If `-u` flag is not defined, source code will check `https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all` by default.
```
$ mirrorlist -u https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=AU
```
Here's a full example.
```
$ mirrorlist -c 10 -m 5 -u https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=AU > mirrorlist
```
